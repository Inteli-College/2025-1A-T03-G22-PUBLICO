This module was highly focused on frontend development, with an emphasis on mapping the required functionalities and utilizing the OpenWebUI interface as the foundation for efficiently integrating the project.

### 1. Review of Documentation and Project Objectives

The initial phase of the module was dedicated to reviewing the documentation generated in Module 1, with the goal of reassessing the project objectives and aligning planned deliverables with the expectations of the team and stakeholders.

### 2. Frontend Functional Requirements

The second sprint focused on identifying and formalizing the essential functional requirements for the frontend, aiming to research technologies and approaches to meet the product's needs.

1. **Tender Document Upload**: The interface must allow users to upload files in various formats (such as PDF and DOCX), with support for large file sizes, providing flexibility and convenience.

2. **Visualization of Analysis Results**: Once the document is processed, results should be displayed in a clear and structured way, emphasizing extracted technical and financial requirements.

3. **Cross-Referencing with Company Certificates**: The interface should allow correlation between the identified requirements and the company's available certifications, highlighting both met and unmet criteria.

4. **Analysis History**: The system should offer a dashboard with historical records of past analyses, enabling future reference and promoting organization and traceability of data.

5. **Progress Feedback**: While uploading and processing files, the interface should display visual progress indicators (such as loading bars or status messages) to keep users informed.

6. **Advanced Search and Filtering**: Users should be able to search and filter analyzed documents by keywords, dates, categories, or eligibility status, allowing quick access to relevant information.

7. **Intuitive and Responsive Interface**: The design should be simple, user-friendly, and adaptable to different devices, ensuring a pleasant user experience even for those with limited technical knowledge.

8. **Exporting Results**: The analysis results should be downloadable or shareable in accessible formats (like PDF or spreadsheets) to support usability and information sharing.

These requirements reflect the real needs of the sales and pre-sales teams, promoting speed, accuracy, and organization in the tender analysis process. Clearly defining these factors was essential to ensure the solution delivers real business value and enhances the company’s competitiveness in the public sector.

### 3. Open WebUI

In this stage, we implemented the Open WebUI-based interface — an open-source solution built around the use of LLMs (Large Language Models) — which meets most of the previously identified requirements.

The interface proved to be an excellent option for the project, as it allows for performance testing in a corporate environment, supports large documents, and increases analysis efficiency. For the requirements that were not fully met, it is possible to develop complementary modules to extend functionality and add further value to the platform.

### 4. Upload Testing

This phase was focused on testing one of the most critical features of the interface: document upload and external file analysis.

During the sprint, I was able to validate and reassess several project assumptions — some were confirmed, others adjusted. For example, after interviews with the pre-sales team, it became clear that their main focus is on RFPs (Requests for Proposal) from companies with which there is already some form of relationship. In such cases, competition and bureaucracy are generally lower compared to traditional public bids.

I also realized that, initially, I was prioritizing the wrong type of document. RFPs should have been the focus from the start, as they are more objective and better aligned with the technical and financial focus of our analysis — ultimately saving time for the pre-sales team.

OpenWebUI also showed promising performance in handling documents and proved compatible with other JavaScript-based technologies, facilitating its integration into the project’s current ecosystem.

This was a highly productive sprint, allowing us to deliver real value to the client and leading the way to the next development cycles with clearer direction and confidence.

### 5. Conclusion

Module 2 laid a solid foundation for frontend development by identifying key requirements and testing effective solutions such as OpenWebUI. Through functional mapping and hands-on experimentation, we successfully aligned the system with the real needs of the pre-sales team, offering a strong base for the next phases of the project and for building a robust, scalable solution.
