The current sprint focused on conducting an in-depth investigation of interface tools for systems based on LLMs (Large Language Models), with the goal of identifying the crucial requirements for frontend development to ensure the project fully meets the client’s needs. As part of this process, a scope interview was also conducted, which significantly contributed to refining the project’s understanding and defining interface priorities.


Based on the problem analysis and the information gathered, the following **8 essential UI/UX requirements** for the system were identified:

1. **Tender Document Upload**: The interface must allow users to upload files in various formats (such as PDF and DOCX), with support for large documents, ensuring ease and flexibility.

2. **Visualization of Analysis Results**: Once the tender document is processed, the results should be displayed clearly and in a structured manner, highlighting the **technical and financial requirements** extracted.

3. **Cross-Referencing with Company Certificates**: The interface must present a cross-check between the identified requirements and the company’s available certificates, showing both fulfilled and unmet criteria.

4. **Analysis History**: The system should provide a dashboard containing the history of previously analyzed documents, allowing for reconsultation and ensuring **data organization and traceability**.

5. **Progress Feedback**: During file upload and processing, the interface should display **visual progress indicators** (such as loading bars or status messages) to keep users informed throughout the process.

6. **Advanced Search and Filtering**: Users should be able to search and filter analyzed tenders by **keywords, dates, categories, or eligibility status**, facilitating quick access to relevant information.

7. **Intuitive and Responsive Interface**: The design must be **simple, user-friendly, and adaptable** to various devices, ensuring smooth navigation even for users with limited technical knowledge.

8. **Exporting Results**: The analysis results should be **downloadable or shareable** in accessible formats such as PDF or spreadsheets, to support usability and information sharing.

These requirements reflect the real needs of the sales and pre-sales teams, promoting **speed, accuracy, and organization** in the tender analysis process. Clearly defining these elements is essential to ensure the solution delivers real business value and increases the company’s competitiveness in the public sector.
