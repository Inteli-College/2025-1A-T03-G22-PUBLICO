The focus of the sprint was to review the documentation produced in the previous module, ensuring its coherence and consistency. A reassessment of the project plan was also carried out, which proved to still be valid, with the exception of some adjustments to the previously established deadlines. Additionally, the main objective of this sprint is to deepen our understanding of OpenWebUI, a platform aimed at building web applications focused on LLMs and their interfaces.
